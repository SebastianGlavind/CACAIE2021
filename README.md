This repository holds supporting material for the paper:

Glavind, S. T., Br√ºske, H., Christensen, E. D, and Faber, M. H., "Bayesian probabilistic representation of complex systems - with application to wave load modeling", accepted for publication in Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering, 2021.

A link to the paper with a description of the example will follow, when the paper is published.

The links below display the material via [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) to ensure a proper rendering of the formulas.

- [A simple principal example on context-specific model selection](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SebastianGlavind/CACAIE2021/blob/main/CACAIE_principleEx_github.ipynb). This notebook shows how the numerical optimization is conducted in the example by the same name.
